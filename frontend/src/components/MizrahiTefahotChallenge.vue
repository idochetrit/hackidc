            <h2><strong>Mizrahi Tefahot</strong></h2>
            <p>For more information or specific questions: <a href="mailto:Hackidc19umtb@gmail.com">Hackidc19umtb@gmail.com</a></p>
            <p>In the past few years, the banking industry has been going through a digital transformation. As part
                of a unique approach in the Israeli banking system, Mizrahi Tefahot believes in giving personal,
                human service to each and every client, and that every person deserves a person in the bank.</p>
            <p>The bank allows its clients to choose which services they prefer to use online, always giving
                them an option to talk to a banker directly. The bank offers services to private and business
                clients in a variety of fields: accounts, mortgages, investments, loans and pensions advisory, as
                well as advanced digital tools and hybrid banking.</p>
            <h4><strong>Challenge no. 1: Small Businesses</strong></h4>
            <p>Small businesses are required to a variety of actions, similarly to large corporations, but with
                much limited resources and abilities. The bank aspires to be an enabler in the business client&#39;s
                activities â€“ to take away some of the burden, and ease the handling of the ongoing operations,
                along with growing the financial activities of the business with the bank.
                <br>
                Plan a technological platform (as flexible and open possible, remember there is no big internal
                IT team in our example firm) that will bring value to the business client, from a managerial and
                operational aspect (not necessarily financial), that will be flexible and able to evolve and
                expand abilities down the road.</p>

            <h4><strong>Challenge no. 2: Private Customer Experience</strong></h4>
            <p>The bank aspires to constantly upgrade its customer experience, while maintaining relevancy to
                a wide range of clients, with varying technological abilities and financial know-how.
                <br>
                Plan technological and smart tools, that will enhance the connection between the personal
                banker and the client, with emphasis on the communication between them, in a way that will
                be entwined in the daily life of the clients.</p>
