              "                        Luke Gray (UK) is a nomadic surrealist painter specializing in chinese ink and graphite works on paper and canvas. Born color blind he was forced to use an almost exclusively black and white palette, working with patterns and textures rather than color. Lukes meticulously detailed works deal with the metaphysical realms of dreams and sacred states. Throughout his work he weaves together themes of religious ritual, ancient mysticism and hallucinogenic visions to create a sense of an otherworldly state.\n" +

After years of experience crafting her skills as a User Experience specialist and Web Designer, she opted to pursue her true passion. Litto's art deals with taboo issues of physical and psychological limit experiences. The process of her work follows three stages: First is the real act, e.g., two models interacting sexually with each other. In this stage, Litto collects pictures and sketches to give herself visual notes. Second stage is the glitch, where the code of the photos will be manipulated and Litto's distinct artistry takes over in this crucial stage. Lastly is the transformation from digital to analogue - the act of painting on canvas. Litto's art work can be found in numerous private collections worldwide.\n"
