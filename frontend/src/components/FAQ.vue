            <h4>What is HackIDC?</h4>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>A hackathon is an event, typically lasting multiple days, in which a large number of people meet to collaboratively build their ideas using technology.</strong></p>
            <p>HackIDC is Israel’s leading student Hackathon, held annually at IDC Herzliya. It is a great opportunity to build something new and exciting, together with coding and design enthusiasts.
              Students work in teams of up to five people for thirty-six hours to create a web, mobile, or hardware product.</p>

            <h4>What am I expected to build?</h4>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>Thirty-six hours isn’t much, but surely enough to bring something to life. You are expected to finish the first version of your product within that time. This can be a demo, POC or a beta version.</strong></p>
            <p>All work eligible for prizes must be completed between Thursday morning after the kick-off and Friday afternoon at the hacking location (IDC Herzliya Campus).</p>
            <p>HackIDC will provide you the best conditions to concentrate on your ideas and their execution.</p>
